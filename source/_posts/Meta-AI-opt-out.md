## Preamble
Artificial Intelligence systems require massive amounts of data to train and improve their capabilities. This data often comes from various sources, including user-generated content, interactions, and personal information shared on social media platforms. The more data these AI systems consume, the more sophisticated they become, but this raises important questions about privacy and user consent.

## Introduction
Meta (formerly Facebook) has announced that starting May 27, 2025, they will begin using user data from both Facebook and Instagram to train their AI models. This includes posts, photos, and other content that users have shared on these platforms. While this move aims to improve Meta\'s AI capabilities, it has raised concerns about privacy and data usage. Users\' content will be used to train various AI features, including content recommendations, automated moderation, and other AI-powered services.

## What to do

If you\'re concerned about your personal data being used to train Meta\'s AI systems, you have the option to opt out. Meta provides a specific form that allows users to submit their opposition to having their data used for AI training purposes. It\'s important to note that this opt-out process needs to be completed separately for both Facebook and Instagram if you use both platforms.
