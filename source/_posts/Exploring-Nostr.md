## Preamble

I recently came across Nostr, a decentralized social network protocol. It\'s not an app or a website, but _simple and open protocol that enables a truly censorship-resistant and global social network_.

## Understanding Nostr

Nostr operates through a network of peers hosting and sharing events. These events can range from a text message to a complex data structure. It\'s a public and transparent protocol, with no central authority to control or censor content. All events are stored and shared equally among peers.

## Sign in to Nostr

Unlike traditional platforms, Nostr doesn\'t use usernames and passwords for access. Instead, it uses a pair of keys - a public key and a private key. Your public key is like your username, and your private key is like your password. However, it\'s crucial to keep your private key secret as it gives access to your Nostr account.

## Nostr clients

To interact with Nostr, you need a Nostr client. There are several clients available, each with their own unique interfaces. Some are web-based, while others are standalone applications. You can choose the one that best suits your needs and preferences from [this list](https://nostr.com/clients).

## My Nostr Public Key

Here\'s my Nostr public key:
