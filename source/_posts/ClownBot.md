## Preamble

Group chats can be boring. So I developed this telegram bot...


## Introduction

ClownBot ([@clown_in_a_bot](https://t.me/clown_in_a_bot)) is a telegram bot that just wants to bring cheer.

## Powers
The bot\'s powers are few, but fun. 

For example, it can reply with funny GIFs chosen randomly from the web to all messages containing _\'Ahahah\'_. Then there are many other Easter Eggs.


## Extra
In all groups of friends there are secrets. Or private funny things.
For this reason the bot was built to have extra features that it\'s possible to add with a simple file.

But not only Easter Eggs! 
More experienced developers can add in `extra.js` more powerful features to use in their own groups.
